Class notes 10-11

l var if _merge ==1 //check merge results
drop _merge //after merge to drop that new variable

You can describe data you haven't loaded but have to be .dta files, not .csv:  describe using http......

check which ones are nonunique:
sort state //if state is the variable you want to see if it's unique
count if state == state [_n-1]
l if state == state [_n-1]

after merging:
l zip5 if _merge~=3
drop _merge
drop if _merge==2 //to drop the ones that didn't merge if you don't need them!

collapse var, by (other var)
preserve
collapse var, by(other var)
save varnewvar, replace
restore //goes back to how it was before preserve

Directory structure:  have a folder for raw data
Stata can produce directory!
Always have only one version of a dofile
Also have the same chunk of code in one place - the parent
You can have multiple do files (hierarchy) or put it all in one
You can also have one master do file:  with a list of the do files with the command "do" in front of them

Labeling is important!
labels appear on output
var name = variable name
var lab describes label - use codebook to find them
