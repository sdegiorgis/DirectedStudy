Graphics!

Get draft of PS 4 up on Git by next class meeting

Questions for Adam before next class:
- How do I invert rows/columns?  ACS data has zip code in rows

Grab code from stata for graphs - code is complicated so always copy code!
Or you can use graphical user interface (GUI)

Stata can do vector or raster - use vector
raster = png, tif
vector = ps, eps, gph, pdf, wmf, emf

help graph intro = code in stata to get graphical help
